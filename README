1. ABOUT
########

This plugin enables the Gnome Rhythmbox music player (http://projects.gnome.org/rhythmbox) to output information of the currently playing track to any type of display supported by the LCDproc driver (http://lcdproc.org). It is based on the "Rhythmbox LCDproc plugin" (http://locoudev.0fees.net) by Loic Andrieu, and I extended it to -- among other things -- make it better handle radio streams, be more robust to disconnections from the LCDproc service and be compatible with the new Rhythmbox API (as of version 0.13.3).

###########
2. FEATURES
###########

 * Displays Title, Artist, Album, current and total time and the track number of the currently playing track, if set.
 * Works for tracks from the local music database as well as for last.fm and regular radio streams. Others have not been tested.
 * Scrolls text that exceeds the display width in two selectable modes: Bouncing or scroll-through.

###############
3. REQUIREMENTS
###############

 * Rhythmbox >=0.13.3 (http://projects.gnome.org/rhythmbox) For pre-0.13.3 Rhythmboxes, try the version in the folder "lcdproc-plugin-pre-0.13.3"
 * LCDproc (http://lcdproc.org, Arch Linux: lcdproc from AUR http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=8344)
 * Python OOP Wrapper Library for LCDproc Telnet API version 0.02 (http://github.com/jingleman/lcdproc)

4. INSTALLATION
###############

Make sure the software under 2. is installed.

Check out the git repository:

$ git clone git@github.com:mikerofone/lcdproc-rhythmbox.git

Either copy (or symlink) the lcdproc-rhythmbox folder to your Rhythmbox plugins folder:

1.$ cd lcdproc-rhythmbox
2a$ cp -R lcdproc-plugin ~/.local/share/rhythmbox/plugins/
 or
2b$ ln -s `pwd` ~/.local/share/rhythmbox/plugins/lcdproc-plugin

Start Rhythmbox, goto Edit->Plugins and tick/activate "LCDproc plugin". Your display should now display the information on the current track or a notice that it is not playing currently.

################
5. CONFIGURATION
################

Currently, there is not too much to configure, and the things that can/need to be configured must be set in the source-code (lcdprog-plugin/lcdproc-plugin.py). The most important parameter is the width of your display (in characters per row), which defaults to 20. You can also decide between two scrolling modes (bounce or scroll-through) for text that exceeds the screen width, and the separation string used in scroll-through scrolling mode. These are set with a gconf-property, but the configuration dialogue is broken and must be fixed.

##################
6. TROUBLESHOOTING
##################

If your display does not change at all, make sure that LCDproc is really running.

Launching Rhythmbox from the command line with the switch -D lcdproc-plugin enabled debug output for the plugin. It will print some status messages and also stack traces in case something should blow.
